<h1>NodeJS-Express API for Quacker</h1>

<h2>Quacker</h2>
<p>Quacker is a state of the art, super useful app. It's kind of like twitter, only better because quacks don't echo, tweets do and cause a lot of damage. Join Quacker and write some quacks. Or don't, no one will hear them anyway, because quacks don't echo. Heh.</p>

<hr>
<p>This is a mini-project meant to mimic Twitter functionality. It has 1 role, get me more familiarized with ReactJS.</p>
